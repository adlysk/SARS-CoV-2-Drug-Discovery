# SARS-CoV-2-Drug-Discovery

<br>The objective of the task was to develop a binary classification model to estimate the cytopathic effect (CPE) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on compounds provided in a dataset. The dataset consists of molecules represented in Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) format, along with corresponding labels indicating their activity as either active (1) or inactive (0) against the viral infectivity.
<br><br>It should be noted that there is a problem with the dataset - not only is there a huge number of missing values, but the features are not described in any way on Kaggle and it looks like some of them (CPE.ACTIVITY, CPE.SIGNIFICANCE) are more like target features rather than those which should be passed as an input to the model even though from Kaggle's description it is more apparent that they are just the regular features. For this reason this repository is more an example of dealing with missing values and building a simple data pipeline than a solution to real classification problem.
